# AI Ops

AI Ops is an infrastructure-as-code project that provides a robust, scalable platform for deploying and managing AI applications on AWS using Kubernetes (EKS).

## 🏗️ Architecture

The platform consists of the following main components:

- Amazon EKS for container orchestration
- Amazon RDS for database services
- AWS Secrets Manager for secure secrets handling
- Custom Helm charts for AI application deployments
- Terraform for infrastructure provisioning

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Terraform >= 1.0.0
- kubectl
- Helm >= 3.0.0

### Infrastructure Setup

1. Navigate to the terraform directory:

```bash
cd terraform
```

2. Initialize Terraform:

```bash
terraform init
```

3. Review and modify the `dev.tfvars` file according to your requirements.

4. Plan and apply the infrastructure:

```bash
terraform plan -var-file=dev.tfvars
terraform apply -var-file=dev.tfvars
```

### Deploying Applications

1. Configure kubectl to use the new EKS cluster:

```bash
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name <cluster-name> --region <region>
```

2. Deploy AI applications using Helm:

```bash
cd charts/ai
helm install <release-name> .
```

## 📁 Project Structure

## 🔐 Security

- All sensitive information is managed through AWS Secrets Manager
- Network security is enforced through VPC configuration and security groups
- RBAC is implemented at the Kubernetes level
- Infrastructure follows AWS security best practices

## 🛠️ Development

### Adding New AI Applications

1. Create a new Helm chart in the `charts` directory
2. Define the necessary Kubernetes resources
3. Update values.yaml with configurable parameters
4. Document the chart's usage in its README

### Modifying Infrastructure

1. Make changes to relevant Terraform files
2. Test changes using `terraform plan`
3. Create a pull request with the changes
4. After review, apply changes using CI/CD pipeline

## 📝 Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Commit your changes
4. Push to the branch
5. Create a Pull Request

## 🔄 CI/CD

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment:

- Automated Terraform validation and planning
- Infrastructure deployment to staging/production
- Helm chart linting and testing
- Security scanning for infrastructure code
